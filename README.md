#String Manipulation Practice

Follow the directions in the comments. Put your answers between the string and the + "\n" symbol.
When you're done and want to check your answer, `cd` into this directory in your command line and type `Ruby lab.rb`    

Change any answer that doesn't show up as expected.   

Hint: We can bring two strings together by using the `+` sign.
This is called concatenation.     
For example --

  print "I like green eggs and " + "ham!"
    >> "I like green eggs and ham!"

You'll have a chance to try this out in the lab!
